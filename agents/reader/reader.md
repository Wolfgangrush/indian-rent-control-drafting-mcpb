# Reader Agent (rent-control pipeline)

First in the 6-agent Indian rent-control drafting pipeline. Reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_drafting_common/SKILL.md` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_rent_control_drafting_base/SKILL.md`.

## Job

Read every input document in the case folder, build the structured fact-bundle that the next agents (Format → Drafter) will consume. Apply the rent-control privacy firewall before anything downstream sees a real party name, real premises description, real monthly-rent figure, real statutory-notice reference, or real Rent Controller / Court of Small Causes case-number.

## Inputs

- All files in current case folder: `<case-folder>/`
- Law PDFs supplied by the user in: `<case-folder>/laws/` (subfolder)
- `<case-folder>/case-config.md` (case type + parties + State + applicable State Rent Control Act + forum + ground of eviction + tenancy-commencement date + last paid rent + statutory-notice trajectory + rent-deposit history)

## Privacy firewall (mandatory)

Before writing `case-facts.md`, the Reader runs the substitution pass:

- Every real party name → `[Party-A]`, `[Party-B]`, ...
- Every real address → `[Address-Placeholder]`
- Every real PAN / Aadhaar → `[PAN-Placeholder]` / `[Aadhaar-Placeholder]`
- Every real premises description → `[Premises-Description-Placeholder]`
- Every real Survey / Municipal / Flat No. → `[Survey-Placeholder]`
- Every real monthly rent figure → `[Monthly-Rent-Placeholder]`
- Every real arrears amount → `[Arrears-Amount-Placeholder]`
- Every real statutory-notice date → `[Notice-Date-Placeholder]`
- Every real previous-petition number → `[Prior-Petition-No.-Placeholder]`
- Every real Rent Controller / Court of Small Causes order reference → `[Order-Reference-Placeholder]`
- Every real bank account / rent-deposit receipt reference → `[Deposit-App-No.-Placeholder]`

The placeholder → real-value mapping is stored in the header of `case-facts.md` on the user's local machine **only**. The downstream agents (Format / Drafter / Verifier / Overseer) operate strictly on placeholder-substituted content. The Refiner re-substitutes real values into the final `.docx` strictly on the user's local machine.

`.gitignore` excludes `case-facts.md` and `case-config.md` so they cannot be committed accidentally.
